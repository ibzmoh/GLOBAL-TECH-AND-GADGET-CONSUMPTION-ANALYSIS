# Global Tech and Gadget Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global technology and gadget consumption patterns across 10 countries (USA, China, UK, Canada, India, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil) over an 11-year period (2015-2025). The analysis examines multiple metrics including smartphone sales, laptop shipments, gaming console adoption, smartwatch penetration, consumer spending, e-waste generation, and 5G adoption rates.

## Key Analyses
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for key technology metrics across countries
- **E-Waste Generation**: Tracked and visualized e-waste production patterns by country over time, identifying peak production years and consistent patterns
- **Consumer Spending Trends**: Analyzed yearly changes in gadget spending across countries, highlighting regional differences and temporal patterns
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Identified potential pandemic effects on smartphone sales between 2020-2021 across different regions
- **Technology Adoption Rates**: Compared smartwatch and 5G penetration rates across different markets
- **Gaming Console Adoption**: Special focus on USA and UK market trends over the decade

## Key Findings
- Canada consistently generated the most e-waste over the study period, while South Korea produced the least
- Peak e-waste production occurred cyclically in 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023
- Smartphone sales in Asia (China, South Korea, Japan) and parts of Europe (UK, France) dropped sharply between 2020-2021, coinciding with COVID-19
- Consumer spending on gadgets hit an all-time low across countries in 2020, with spending patterns becoming erratic in subsequent years
- France led in 5G adoption (58% mean penetration), followed by the USA (54.27%)
- Brazil had the highest smartwatch penetration rate (16.03%), while China had the lowest (12.09%)

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Programming Languages & Tools
- **Python**: Core language for data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Advanced multi-panel visualization with customized formatting
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization with boxplots

### Data Analysis Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data investigation and pattern identification
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Statistical summary of technology adoption and consumption patterns
- **Data Grouping and Aggregation**: Country and year-based aggregations
- **Time Series Analysis**: Year-over-year trend analysis for multiple metrics
- **Comparative Analysis**: Cross-country technology adoption comparison

### Data Visualization
- **Multi-panel Plotting**: Creating sophisticated grid-based visualizations
- **Custom Formatting**: Tailored labels, colors, grids, and annotations
- **Categorical Data Visualization**: Bar charts for country comparisons
- **Time Series Visualization**: Trend lines with event markers (COVID-19 period)
- **Statistical Visualization**: Boxplots for distribution analysis and outlier detection

### Data Interpretation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying cyclical trends in e-waste generation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spotting outliers in consumer spending and e-waste data
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between events (COVID-19) and technology metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracking adoption rates of emerging technologies (5G, smartwatches)

## Future Work
- Conduct deeper analysis on the relationships between consumer spending and e-waste generation
- Incorporate additional variables such as GDP, population demographics, and environmental regulations
- Develop predictive models for future technology adoption rates
- Expand country coverage to include developing markets
